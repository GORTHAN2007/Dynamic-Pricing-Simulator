# Project Title: Dynamic Pricing Simulator
One line project description: An autonomous economic simulation engine that can stress-test dynamic pricing models against AI-driven competitor agents to maximize revenue and inventory health.

## 1. Problem Statement
### Problem Title: 
Businesses lack an interactive simulation system that models pricing decisions under realistic constraints.
### Problem Description: 
In competitive e-commerce markets, pricing decisions directly impact revenue, market share, and inventory turnover. Businesses must constantly balance demand elasticity, competitor behavior, and stock availability while adjusting pricing strategies. However, most pricing decisions are made using static spreadsheets or limited historical data analysis. There is limited opportunity to simulate dynamic market environments before implementing pricing strategies in real-world systems.

### Target Users: 
* E-commerce Category Managers
* Revenue Growth and Optimization Teams
* Inventory and Supply Chain Analysts

### Existing Gaps
* Businesses lack an interactive simulation system that models pricing under realistic constraints.
* Difficulty in modeling demand curves and competitor reactions accurately.
* Inability to evaluate the long-term impact of short-term pricing "race-to-the-bottom" tactics.
* Without predictive simulation:
    Pricing strategies may reduce profit margins
    Overstock or stockouts may occur
    Market share may decline unexpectedly
    Businesses react rather than strategize
    Revenue optimization opportunities are missed
    Lack of experimentation tools limits strategic decision-making.
